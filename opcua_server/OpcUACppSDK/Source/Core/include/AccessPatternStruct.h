* The pattern is identified by a 16-bit handle and each variable in the server can refer to such a defined
* pattern.
* Such a pattern defines for each UserGroup the access rights for that user group by a bytefield.
* Each session stores a GroupIndex which is - decremented by 1- the index in that array (the GroupIndex
* 0 is reserved and means UserAccessRights = Default-AccessRights).
*
* E.g. a sequence 0x03, 0x01 in the accessField means for variables referring to this pattern:
* Users from group 1 (the index is 1-based) are allowed to read and write the current value .
* Users from group 2 are only allowed to read the current value (write bit is not set).
* Each Variable and each method in the server can define the pattern to use for this variable. */
