		* the affected object. In order to provide the requested historical events, a server application
		* may want to override this method.
		*
		* For optimization reasons, a server application may want to change the request dispatching
		* behavior of the transaction (e.g. to bundle requests for nodes when requesting event field values
		* from an underlying historian). This can be achieved by subclassing the transaction and
		* providing a custom implementation for handleRequests(). Please note that the subclass must
		* also be added to the application's Creator (Transactions are created by the toolbox core -
