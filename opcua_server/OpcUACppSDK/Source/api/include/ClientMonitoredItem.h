			/*! @brief Adds a list of MonitoredItems that shall be reported when this MonitoredItem triggers.
			*
			* OPC UA allows setting up MonitoredItems that report their data changes or events only
			* if they are triggered by some other MonitoredItem. The triggering mechanism is a useful
			* feature that allows clients to reduce the data volume on the wire by configuring some MonitoredItems
			* to sample frequently but only report when some other event happens.
			*
			* The monitoring mode of the items to report (i.e. triggered items) is set to sampling-only so that it
			* will sample and queue notifications without reporting them.
			*
			* The following triggering modes are defined:
			* @li	If the monitoring mode of the triggering item is SAMPLING, then it is not reported when the
			*		triggering item triggers the items to report.
			* @li	If the monitoring mode of the triggering item is REPORTING, then it is reported when the triggering
			*		item triggers the items to report.
			* @li	If the monitoring mode of the triggering item is DISABLED, then the triggering item does not trigger
			*		the items to report.
			* @li	If the monitoring mode of the item to report is SAMPLING, then it is reported when the triggering item
			*		triggers the items to report.
			* @li	If the monitoring mode of the item to report is REPORTING, this effectively causes the triggering item
			*		to be ignored. All notifications of the items to report are sent after the publishing interval expires.
			* @li	If the monitoring mode of the item to report is DISABLED, then there will be no sampling of the item to
			*		report and therefore no notifications to report.
			*
			* @param itemsToReport	A list of MonitoredItems that shall report their notifications when this
			*						MonitoredItem triggers.
			*
			* @note	Please note that both the reporting MonitoredItems and the triggering MonitoredItem need
