	/*! An AccessPattern is used to implement user authorization in an OPC UA server
	* and defines access rights for Variables and Methods for one or more user groups.
	*
	* The SDK uses a matrix to organize user access rights. The AccessPatterns represent the rows
	* and user groups represent the columns of this matrix. The whole matrix is represented as a vector
	* of AccessPatterns which contain an AccessField (ByteString) where each byte is a bit mask for one user group
	* of this pattern.
	*
	* A server may define user rights for accessing the "Value" attribute of Variables and user rights
	* for executing Methods. In the address space, the right of a certain user to access a Variable's value
	* or to execute a Method is made visible by the attributes "UserAccessLevel" resp. "UserExecutable".
	*
	* Each AccessPattern is identified by an arbitrary key and each Variable or Method in the server may use the
	* key to refer to an AccessPattern. The SDK defines a reserved default access pattern (key = 0) that
	* uses the AccessLevel (not UserAccessLevel) attribute of a Variable resp. the Executable
	* (not UserExecutable) attribute of a Method, regardless of the user group.
	*
	* @note	Please note that the SDK defines a default AccessPattern with key "0" that uses
	*		the value of the Variable's AccessLevel resp. the Method's Executable attribute.
	*		This special AccessPattern cannot be overridden. Please note that the ByteStrings for the user
	*		groups of all AccessPatterns shall have the same size.
